# MIPS-Simulator

This simulator takes a 32-bit MIPS instruction as input, decodes it, and performs the corresponding operation, simulating the core functionalities of the MIPS architecture. It supports a wide range of MIPS instructions, including R-type, I-type, and J-type operationsâ€”covering everything from arithmetic and logical instructions and Branching.
