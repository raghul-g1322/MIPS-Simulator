# MIPS-Simulator

This project is a MIPS Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Simulator built in C language, designed to simulate the execution of 32-bit MIPS instructions. The simulator decodes and executes MIPS instructions while maintaining the behavior of registers and memory, giving insights into how low-level instructions operate on real hardware.

This simulator takes a 32-bit MIPS instruction as input, decodes it, and performs the corresponding operation, simulating the core functionalities of the MIPS architecture. It supports a wide range of MIPS instructions, including R-type, I-type, and J-type operations—covering everything from arithmetic and logical instructions and Branching.

🚀 Features
      ✅ Supports most MIPS instructions (R-type, I-type, and J-type)
      ✅ 32-bit instruction decoding and binary parsing
      ✅ Register file simulation with 32 registers
      ✅ Memory access instructions (load/store)
      ✅ Arithmetic, logical, shift, and branching operations
      ✅ Robust error handling and modular code structure
      ✅ Includes 50+ test cases for validation and verification

🛠️ Technologies Used
      Language: C (compiled with gcc)
      Test Cases: Plain text input files simulating instruction binaries
      Tools: Terminal/Command Line for execution and debugging
